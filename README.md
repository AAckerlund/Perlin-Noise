This Java project implements a seeded, tileable version of perlin noise.

Editable values:
* Seed: modifyes the random noise "seed" array.
* Octaves: The number of points to sample, higher octave value gives more detail.
* Scale Bias: determines how much each octave is scaled by (Default value of 2)
* Cutoff Values: Toggles between the true perlin values and cutoff values that make it easier to see noise distributions.

Currently there are no plans to expand this project, however I would like to implement this code in other languages.
